This is a place holder. I am writing this offline in MacDown cuz I love WYSIWYG. Feel free to add your tips so we can merge! 

**Note to contributors.** Please save your files with an extension. Most of them are in rst, but a couple are in markdown. Even if you love WYSIWYG, you can append extensions to the filenames!
